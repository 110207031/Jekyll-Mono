# Jekyll-Mono

Jekylly-Mono is a simple and elegant Github Profile cum Blog theme based on Barry Clark's [Jekyll-Now]("https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now"). It's a result of my attempt to learn Jekyll and create a minimalistic theme to put up my CV alongwith some blog posts.

Jekyll-Mono was crafted with <3 by [Akshay Agarwal](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007).

## What is Jekyll?

It is a static site generator. It takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through your templates and spits it out as a complete static website, ready to be served using Github pages for free.

Because your entire blog is static it serves and perform faster. It consumes  less web resources namely memory and I/O.
